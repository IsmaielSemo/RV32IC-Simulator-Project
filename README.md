# RV32IC-Simulator-Project
This project will contain all files for Assembly project 1 under Dr Mohamed Shalan.

This project is completed by Ismaiel Sabet, Seif Elansari, and Jana Fadl.

Process:
We first started with taking in the skeleton code, understanding it, and then complete the rest of the R-type insturction set. Then, we implemented the I-type instructions (both opcodes for non-load and load instructions respectively). We then did the B-type instructions and the S-type instructions, before attempting to explore some of the execution part with the R-type and I-type, followed by the B-type.

Expected functionality:
The program will take in (in both terminal and i/o) a file containing 32 bit machine code. The code will be deciphered and the appropriate instruction will be displayed. Then, the instruction will be executed and the appropriate output will be displayed.

Individual Contributions:
Ismaiel: I-type format instructions, B-type instructions and B-type instructions execution
Seif: R-type format instructions, R-type instructions execution, I-type instructions execution
Jana: S-type format instructions
